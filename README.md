## üëÄ Inspiration
I was watching a young chinese boy scroll **YouTube Shorts** today. I noticed this **horrible** #habit of his, and in an effort to #help, I #slapped him across his **face**. This was the beginning #of #our #intense **iteration** processs to land on Productivitazer.

## üíÄ What it does
Productivitazer sends an electrical shock to the user whenever they go on a website they are trying to stop using. Not only does Productivitazer stop the website from opening and loading, it also provides that pain for the brain to recognize that that app has got to go away. bars.

## üöÄ How we built it
We built it with WXT, Vite, React, Tailwind, and some other things, yo. We even used hardware, like 5 9 volt batteries, and arduino, bluetooth receiver.

## üò≠ Challenges we ran into
"DUDE WHY IS IT NOT WORKING?! IT LITERALLY WON'T LET ME CONNECT TO BLUE TOOTH FROM THIS STUPID WEB THING! ARGHHHHHHHH" - Daniel.

We faced challenges in connecting to Bluetooth successfully to deliver the shock wirelessly. We also couldn't find a capacitor, which was very important for the functionality of Productivitazer. We ran around to like 5 different walmarts, nofrills, dollaramas, cyber stores, phone repair, and convenience and none of them had capacitors.

## üôè Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of getting the Bluetooth working. At the time of writing, we haven't yet, but I'm sure we will in the next 8 hours.

We listened to about 5 hours of Santo & Johnny.

Somebody knocked on our door to wake us up probably like 5 times.

## ‚ùå What we learned
We learned not only about how to connect to Bluetooth, but also more important skills that transfer everywhere; we learned the importance of preparation. We originally did not prepare our materials correctly, and so we had to go around Guelph trying to buy different components, wasting a lot of time and creating unnecessary stress.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è What's next for Productivitazer
We hope to get into big retailers like www.mrbeast.store
