## How to use
Soon, you will be able to download from the Chrome Web Store. This extension only works on Chromium browsers (Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Brave, Arc, etc). Maybe eventually we'll build a Firefox extension or an app.
1. Download a new release from [here](https://github.com/Yourself1011/productivity-taser/releases). 
2. Go to your browser's extension settings.
3. Toggle on developer mode.
4. Press "Load Unpacked".
5. Unzip and upload the release. 

## How to set up Arduino
We'll put the circuit schematic here later.
